# ðŸ“˜ SAS Learning Notes 2025

Welcome to my SAS learning repository!  
This repo documents my journey in mastering SAS programming, with a focus on CDISC standards, base syntax, macro programming, and advanced clinical trial data handling.

This learning process supports my preparation for:
- ðŸ§ª SAS Base / Advanced
- ðŸ§¬ CDISC ADaM/SDTM standards
- ðŸ’¼ Clinical trial programming best practices
